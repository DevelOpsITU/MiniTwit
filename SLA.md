# Service Level Agreement
## Uptime
During the Term of agreement under which Group D has agreed to provide Minitwit to customers, the service will provide a monthly uptime percentage (MUP) to all its customers with following service level objective (SLO).
| Service     | MUP         |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Minitwit    | >= 99.9%    |

If Group D does not meet the SLO, and the customer complaints under this SLA, the customer will be eligible, if it has applied the CNBO (see below), to recieve apologetic regretful sweeteners described below. If customers or partners are reselling or otherwise distributing the services, only the reseller is applicable for the sweeterners, and not its customers.
#### CNBO
<sub>common no brain operations</sub>
* "Back-off" - The customer is responsible for waiting for a satisfactory time period before issuing an issue/complaint. This time period starts at 2 sec, and increases exponentially.

| MUP         | Sweetener   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 99.9% - 99% | Clap on the shoulder  |
| 99% - 95% | An official apology from Group D  |

##### Apologetic Sweetener
In order to receive any of the apologetic sweeterners described above, the customer must notify Group D through the technical support options, described further down in the SLA, within a inconsequential 10 minutes from the time the customer obsereves the issue.

#### Maximum sweeterners
The maximum number of apologetic sweeterners to be issued by Group D, per customer for any services and downtimes is singular.
