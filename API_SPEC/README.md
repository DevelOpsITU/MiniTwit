# API Simulator

This is used to test that the simulator is correct.


**How it works:**
- run the go application (main.go)
- run the minitwit_simulator.py with the url of the application as input:
  - Example: 'python3 minitwit_simulator.py http://localhost:8080/sim'
- If no errors when run, it should mean it works.
